Sergio, the one-man army!, from backend to frontend to CI to leadership and to whatever crosses the road(map). You are so much more than what your profile shows, and it is such a joy to work with you. 

Your dedication and ability to grow has been astonishing to date, and sure to get even better in the future, you are a steady reference for us and the high standards you set every day. 

You have built one of the best teams I have ever worked with, where I could delegate any task without a worry, and your tech focus has been a light in the darkness for everyone more often than I care to remember, way to go!
