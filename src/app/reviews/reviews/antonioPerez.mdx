I had the privilege of leading the engineering group in which Sergio was, in turn, the lead of a development team. Communication with him was always smooth and direct, and his work management style was extremely transparent and consistent. Both I and his team always had a clear understanding of the status of ongoing initiatives and planning, thanks to Sergio’s strong organizational and management skills.

After a team restructuring and headcount reduction, I proposed to Sergio the challenge of transitioning back into a senior engineering role, focusing purely on technical work without people management responsibilities. He accepted the challenge and showed strong commitment to the team that, at that point, needed his talent most as a developer.

He is an excellent developer — thorough and detail-oriented in everything related to code and technical solutions. The quality of his technical work is always outstanding. His contributions to refactoring our codebase to evolve the product have significantly improved the maintainability and scalability of our planned developments. Likewise, his work on automating CI/CD processes and updating dependencies has meaningfully reduced the time required for certification and deployment.

Sergio is an exceptional professional who makes every team better, and he’s also a fantastic person to work with. I wouldn’t hesitate for a second to work with him again if the opportunity arose.
