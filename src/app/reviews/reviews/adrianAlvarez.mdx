I had the pleasure of working with Sergio in different stages: both as a fellow software developer and later under his leadership when he became my Team Lead. In every context, Sergio proved to be an outstanding professional.


He has an impressive ability to quickly learn and master new technologies. Not only does he adapt with ease, but he also adds value from day one. He’s proactive, always willing to help, and has a great attitude when it comes to sharing knowledge with the team.


One of the projects where he truly stood out was when he became our go-to expert for GitLab CI. He designed pipelines that fully automated our CI/CD process — from optimizing build and test times to deploying to pre-production environments, even generating the final merge request for production automatically. It was a real game-changer for our workflow.


Beyond his technical skills, Sergio is an exceptional person — approachable, generous with his time, and always ready to collaborate. Working with him is easy, and above all, deeply enriching.


I recommend Sergio without hesitation for any technical role — whether front-end, back-end, or fullstack. His experience leading teams also makes him a well-rounded professional, combining deep technical expertise with strong leadership skills.
